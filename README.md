# Getting started

This quick guide to leverage this repo to customize the [source-to-image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) jupyter notebook builder image for OpenDatahub JupyterHub. This branch creates an ubuntu based s2i builder image for the jupyter container that takes the [textbook content](https://github.com/jappavoo/UndertheCovers) and generate a new image which can be deployed in ODH environment. 

>**_Note:_** This container is only a template and does not contain the textbook content.

## Anatomy of the branch

We have the base directory that includes files like requirements, and other configurations required during the build step. The layout of this branch looks like:<br/>
<br/><br/>
## Configurations

Listing significant configurations part of the build process.
- base-image: 
	* **docker.io/jupyter/minimal-notebook:2022-07-07** is the base image used, configured as: <base_registry>/<base_image>:<base_tag>
	* The respective files as available under folder 'base'
- Adding system libraries:
	* Distribution package listed in 'base/distro_pkgs' installs the system libraries during the build time
- Adding python libraries:
   * List of pre-requisites that should be installed before other python libraries to be updated in 'base/python_prereqs'
   * To specify python libraries update 'base/python_prereqs' file
- Jupter extensions:
   * Extensions to be **enabled** - 'base/jupyter_enable_etxs'
   * Extensions to be **disabled** - 'base/jupyter_disable_etxs'
- Default user id:
   * 'base/ope_uid' file should have the platform assigned uid. **UID mismatch will result in a failure of server launch**

- makefile -defines the set of commands/targets to run against the base image, described in a separate section.

## Repo Lineage
&nbsp;&nbsp;  This UndertheCovers repo is customized from [OPE/container-jupyter-docker-stacks](https://github.com/OPEFFORT/ope/tree/container-jupyter-docker-stacks) for [UndertheCovers](https://github.com/jappavoo/UndertheCovers/tree/main) textbook content.
<br/><br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;  This repo includes additional libraries to support the content. Further customization available as branches with a prefix **'container-'** includes the deployment environment-specific configurations like development, testing, production etc.

#### Updating default user id:
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  When customizing the image for a new environment, 'base/ope_uid' file should reflect the target platform's assigned user id. **Images built with improper UID will result in a failure of server launch**

#### CUST variable:
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  When building customized the image for a new environment, the mandatory variable with build 'CUST' should be assigned appropriate value. 
 For instance, 'make CUST=dev build', 'make CUST=prod build' etc.

## Docker build process

The container template is created over two stages to achieve better organization and to reduce size. 

**Stage one:**
- Add libraries required to install/build development dependencies

**Stage two:**
- Copy the final binary folders from stage-one.
- Include artifacts(executables, configs) from local
- Enable jupyter extensions
- Foler permissions


The final image created after second stage contains only the required binaries, the process looks like :<br/>

## Additional Resources

### Makefile - targets
This repo utilizes make tool to efficiently build, run, tag and publish the jupyter notebook s2i builder image. 
- build - builds the custom s2i builder image
- push - push current built to private registry
- publish - push the current private build to public registry
- pull - pull the most recent public image
- pull-priv - pulls the most recent private image
- root - executes the private image as root user
- user - executes the private image as the default user
- run - starts published version with jupyter lab interface
- run-priv - starts private version with jupyter lab interface
### Adding python packages
&nbsp;S2i framework uses [micropipenv](https://github.com/thoth-station/micropipenv) a pip wrapper tool to manage the python library installation. The requirements file generated using micropipenv should be updated in the repository to include additional python libraries. 

<br/> Follow the steps to generate requirements.txt using micropipenv [here](https://github.com/AbiShanna/Ope-Documentation/tree/main/micropipenv).

### Launching in desktop
The desktop mode requires the image to be re-built with the local user-id in your local workstation that has docker running, 
- Clone the git repository
- Checkout branch 'container'
- Update the base/ope_uid with that of your local user id
- Build the image using 'make CUST=local build'
- Launch the container using 'make CUST=local run'
